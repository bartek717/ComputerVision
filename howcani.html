<h1>How can I get started with Computer Vision?</h1><br><br>
<h2>It is quite easy to get started with computer vision, assuming you have knowledge in python. Using OpenCV, an optimised computer vision library, trying out computer vision concepts is extremely simple.
<br><br>

<h2>Above is an example of the Haar face recognition algorithm, which I was able to implement through OpenCV in just 25 lines of code.
<br><br>
The code is available below, with the main portion under videocamera.py.

<br><br>
If you decide to dive deeper into Computer Vision, I recommend that you try not to use much of the inbuilt functionality in OpenCV, as it oversimplifies the implementation, and you do not learn about the algorithms themselves.
